This package contains the code used in the paper "A Linearly Convergent Method for Non-smooth Non-convex Optimization on Grassmannian with Applications to Robust Subspace and Dictionary Learning". 

This code has been tested to run in MATLAB R2018a.

If you use this code in an academic paper, please cite our paper:
